## About Me

I am a cryptography analyst at [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/).
{{< figure class="avatar" src="/photo.jpeg">}}

Previously, I was an Invited Assistant Professor at the Department of Informatics of the Faculty of Sciences, University of Lisbon.

I have a PhD in Information Security from [IST](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/), Universidade de Lisboa. In my thesis, I studied conditions that allow the combination of satisfiability solvers, as well as probabilistic logics and their satisfiability procedures.


## Interests

I interested in cryptography, vulnerability research, logic, automated reasoning and type theory.

I have played CTF's since 2014 with [STT](https://sectt.github.io/).


## Vulnerability Research
 - I participated in the [EU-FOSSA](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/eu-fossa-2) program and audited the ssh PuTTY source code for one month. The highest severity vulnerabilities were:
     - **DSA signature bypass allows to MITM SSH sessions**: More details [here](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/wishlist/vuln-dss-verify.html).
     - [CVE-2019-9894](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9894): Integer overflow to OOB write during RSA key exchange. More details [here](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/wishlist/vuln-rsa-kex-integer-overflow.html).
